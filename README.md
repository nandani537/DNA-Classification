📂 Dataset
📌 Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Promoter Gene Sequences

📌 Description:

106 DNA sequences (each with 57 nucleotide bases)
Class labels:
+ → Promoter (Indicates the presence of a promoter sequence)
- → Non-Promoter (Indicates the absence of a promoter sequence)
📌 What is a Promoter?
A promoter is a DNA sequence that initiates gene transcription. Identifying promoters is essential for understanding gene regulation and genetic expression.

🔬 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
✔ Load dataset using pandas.
✔ Split DNA sequences into individual nucleotides (A, C, G, T).
✔ Convert categorical sequence data into numerical format using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies).

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Class Distribution Visualization using seaborn.
✔ Nucleotide Frequency Analysis to check occurrences of each base (A, C, G, T).
✔ Summary Statistics using df.describe().

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
✔ Convert nucleotide sequences into one-hot encoded format.
✔ Transform class labels (+, -) into binary format (1 for promoters, 0 for non-promoters).

4️⃣ Model Training
✔ Split data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets using train_test_split.
✔ Train the dataset using multiple machine learning classifiers, including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gaussian Process Classifier
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network
AdaBoost
Naïve Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Linear
RBF
Sigmoid
5️⃣ Model Evaluation
✔ 10-fold Cross-Validation to evaluate models.
✔ Performance metrics:

Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Confusion Matrix
